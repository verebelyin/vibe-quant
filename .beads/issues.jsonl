{"id":"vibe-quant-1fil","title":"Visual Condition Builder - row-based entry/exit condition builder with dropdowns","description":"Current: Entry/exit conditions are free-form text areas where users type condition strings like 'rsi_14 \u003c 30'. No autocomplete, no syntax highlighting, errors only at save time.\n\nProblem: This is the single biggest UX gap. Users must memorize condition syntax, indicator names, and operators. Typos aren't caught until validation. Composer and 3Commas solve this with visual builders.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- Row-based condition builder with 4 columns:\n  - Col 1: Left operand dropdown (defined indicators + close/open/high/low)\n  - Col 2: Operator dropdown (\u003c, \u003e, \u003c=, \u003e=, crosses_above, crosses_below, between)\n  - Col 3: Right operand (number input or indicator dropdown, contextual)\n  - Col 4: [+] Add / [-] Remove buttons\n- AND logic between conditions (matching current DSL semantics)\n- Each row auto-generates the condition string\n- 'Advanced: raw condition' toggle per row for free-text edge cases\n- Real-time condition validation with green checkmarks per row\n- Toggle between visual builder and raw text mode\n- Support for 'between' operator (shows two value inputs)\n- Separate builder sections for long entry, short entry, long exit, short exit\n\nFiles to modify:\n- vibe_quant/dashboard/pages/strategy_management.py (replace condition text areas)\n- New: vibe_quant/dashboard/components/condition_builder.py\n- vibe_quant/dsl/conditions.py (add condition parsing for builder integration)\n\nPriority: P1 (High).

Leading platforms use Monaco or CodeMirror 6 with schema-based validation, hover docs, and code folding.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- Replace st.text_area with streamlit-monaco or streamlit-code-editor component\n- YAML syntax highlighting with proper color scheme\n- Schema-based autocompletion for indicator types, timeframes, operators, sources\n- Inline error markers (red squiggly underlines) on validation errors\n- Hover documentation showing field descriptions from Pydantic model docstrings\n- Code folding for indicators, conditions, time_filters sections\n- Line numbers\n- Real-time validation (debounced 500ms) showing errors inline, not just on button click\n- Side panel showing parsed strategy summary (indicators, conditions, risk params) updating live\n- Snippet insertion buttons for common patterns (add indicator, add condition, add session)\n\nFiles to modify:\n- vibe_quant/dashboard/pages/strategy_management.py (replace YAML editor)\n- pyproject.toml (add streamlit-monaco or streamlit-code-editor dependency)\n- New: vibe_quant/dashboard/components/yaml_editor.py (editor wrapper with validation)\n- vibe_quant/dsl/schema.py (export JSON Schema for editor autocomplete)\n\nPriority: P1 (High).
